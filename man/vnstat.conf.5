.TH VNSTAT.CONF 5 "JULY 2009" "version 1.8" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
vnstat.conf \- vnStat configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/vnstat.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR vnstat (1),
.BR vnstati (1)
and
.BR vnstatd (1)
all use the same configuration file for storing configuration data.
Some of the settings are common for all three programs. The file
contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line. Lines starting with
'#' and empty lines are interpreted as comments and not processed.
Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order
to represent arguments containing spaces. Arguments can be padded
with spaces or tabulator characters. A hardcoded default value
will be used if a keyword can't be found from the configuration file.
