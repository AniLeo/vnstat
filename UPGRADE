Upgrading from versions 1.3 and later
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

1) Follow the normal install procedure, 'make install' step will upgrade the
   configuration file if it exists in the usual location. All user settings
   will be kept. However, unidentified content will get cleaned away.

2) Review the updated configuration file. Refer to the vnstat.conf man page
   for more detailed documentation regarding each setting.

3) If the daemon (vnstatd) is used then restart the daemon after the
   configuration file has been updated.

4) Upgrades from 1.x to 2.x will result in data being imported from the
   legacy databases of each interface during the first start of the new
   daemon (vnstatd) binary. The vnstat and vnstati commands will not be able
   to access any data before this part of the upgrade has been completed.
   The legacy databases will be left untouched by the import.
