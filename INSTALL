Installing vnStat
:::::::::::::::::

 vnStat supports two different types of installing: 'root' and 'singleuser'.
 The difference is that in 'root' ('multiuser' in version 1.0) every user
 having required rights to run the vnStat binary can access stats but don't
 need to worry about updating related things. On the other hand, 'singleuser'
 makes it possible to install vnStat even for users who don't have access
 to the root account.

 So which type should be chosen? If you have access to the root account then
 'root' is the right selection. Otherwise 'singleuser' is the only option.

 Those upgrading from version 1.0 should read the UPGRADE file before
 proceeding.


'root' install
::::::::::::::

 First login as root and run the following two commands:

     make
     make install

 Those having 64bit counters in /proc/net/dev should use 'make 64bit'
 instead of 'make'. If there was no errors, vnStat should now be installed
 (warnings aren't aren't considered as errors). During version 1.0 it
 became clear that some kernels are broken and don't provide to correct
 boot time for the system. vnStat requires this information so there's a
 test to see if the kernel if working right.

     vnstat --testkernel

 The only way to fix a faulty kernel (afaik) is to compile/install a newer
 one. Next every interface that should be monitored needs to be introduced
 to vnStat. Replace eth0 if needed.

     vnstat -u -i eth0

 Repeat that for every other interface you wish to use. After that wait
 for about 1 MB of network traffic (and 5 min).

     vnstat

 Now you should get some stats about your network usage.


'singleuser' install
::::::::::::::::::::

 This install method is a little bit more complicated but shouldn't be
 impossible. :) First compile the binary.

     make single

 Those having 64bit counters in /proc/net/dev should use 'make 64bitsingle'
 instead of 'make single'. If there was no errors, copy src/vnstat to some
 directory included in your $PATH (~/bin/ is an example)  and make the
 database directory.

     cp src/vnstat ~/bin/
     mkdir ~/.vnstat

 During version 1.0 it became clear that some kernels are broken and don't
 provide to correct boot time for the system. vnStat requires this information
 so there's a test to see if the kernel if working right.

     vnstat --testkernel

 If this gives 'command not found' then check your $PATH. The only way to fix
 a faulty kernel (afaik) is to compile/install a newer one. This can't be done
 without the root account so you'll have to solve this problem with your
 sysadmin if the kernel is broken.

 Next every interface that should be monitored needs to be introduced
 to vnStat. Replace eth0 if needed.

     vnstat -u -i eth0

 Repeat that for every other interface you wish to use. Now it's time to add
 a crontab entry for vnStat. Do that by executing the command 'crontab -e'
 and add the following line (without leading spaces, remember to change the
 path):

     0-55/5 * * * * ~/bin/vnstat -u

 If you found yourself using a strange editor then 'man vi' should help.
 After that wait for about 1 MB of network traffic (and 5 min).

     vnstat

 Now you should get some stats about your network usage.
