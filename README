Because vnStat is quite simple to use and the description is already
on the webpage I wont repeat it here.

How to install:

 vnStat can be installed either to be used only with a single user or by
 every users (or some limited group) of the system. Installing vnStat in
 multiuser mode is probably what most will do:

      (log in as root)
      make
      make install

 and after that vnStat is installed and ready to be configured. Still logged
 as root run 'vnstat -u -i eth0' (replace eth0 with the interface you'd like
 to use). Now just wait for 10 min. (and enough traffic) and you should get
 some output by running 'vnstat'.


 If for some reason vnStat needs to be installed in single user mode (you
 don't have root permissions?) then the procedure is the following:

      make singleuser

 and copy the vnstat binary to some directory included in your $PATH,
 something like ~/bin/ might work. After that run 'vnstat -u -i eth0'
 (replace eth0...) and make a crontab entry for 'vnstat -u' that will
 run it every 5 min. It might look something like this:

      0-55/5 * * * * ~/bin/vnstat -u

 Again wait for some traffic to logged and should output should be shown
 with 'vnstat'.
