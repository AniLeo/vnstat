What is vnStat
::::::::::::::

 In short, vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the
 /proc -filesystem to get the needed information. This means that vnStat wont 
 actually be sniffing any traffic. See the webpage for few 'screenshots'.


Getting started
:::::::::::::::

 First you should install vnStat. See the INSTALL file, it contains all needed
 information for the installing process. Users of version 1.0 should see the 
 UPGRADE file first.


Available options
:::::::::::::::::

 A list of commonly used options is available with 'vnstat --help'. The
 complete list can be accessed with 'vnstat --longhelp'. See the man(1)
 page for option explanations.


Usage tips
::::::::::

 vnStat has few settings that can be changed before compiling by editing
 vnstat.h that's included in the src directory. There's comments included
 so see the file with some plain text editor and recompile (and reinstall)
 after any changes.

 However, it's likely that someone will ask anyway how to change the date
 format so here's a short howto about that. First go to the src directory
 and open vnstat.h. Search lines 21-23, those should look like these:

#define DFORMAT "%d.%m."
#define MFORMAT "%b '%y"
#define TFORMAT "%d.%m.%y"

 In order to get the date format to look like what's used for example in
 the US change those lines to:

#define DFORMAT "%m/%d"
#define MFORMAT "%b '%y"
#define TFORMAT "%m/%d/%y"

 and run 'make' (or 'make single') after that in that same src directory or
 continue with the install procedure if you were wise enough to read this
 file before installing. :)
 
 Next, copy the binary over the old one

   cp vnstat /usr/bin/vnstat

 or some other path that you've used. Changing the date format wont affect
 the database in any way.
